Unable to load sec.protocol plugin libXrdSecztn.so
Ending on a ROOT error message.  No histograms will be produced.
If the message talks about "TNetXNGFile", this could be a problem with dCache.  The message is:
TFile::TFile: file /minerva/app/users/sultana/cmtuser/WorkingArea/LowRecoilPions/LowRecoilPions/util/lowQ2pi_weights.root does not exist

*** USAGE ***
runEventLoop <dataPlaylist.txt> <mcPlaylist.txt>

*** Explanation ***
Reduce MasterAnaDev AnaTuples to event selection histograms to extract a
single-differential inclusive cross section for the 2021 MINERvA 101 tutorial.

*** The Input Files ***
Playlist files are plaintext files with 1 file name per line.  Filenames may be
xrootd URLs or refer to the local filesystem.  The first playlist file's
entries will be treated like data, and the second playlist's entries must
have the "Truth" tree to use for calculating the efficiency denominator.

*** Output ***
Produces a two files, runEventLoopMC.root and runEventLoopData.root, with
all histograms needed for the ExtractCrossSection program also built by this
package.  You'll need a .rootlogon.C that loads ROOT object definitions from
PlotUtils to access systematics information from these files.

*** Environment Variables ***
Setting up this package appends to PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  PLOTUTILSROOT,
MPARAMFILESROOT, and MPARAMFILES must be set according to the setup scripts in
those packages for systematics and flux reweighters to function.
If MNV101_SKIP_SYST is defined at all, output histograms will have no error bands.
This is useful for debugging the CV and running warping studies.

*** Return Codes ***
0 indicates success.  All histograms are valid only in this case.  Any other
return code indicates that histograms should not be used.  Error messages
about what went wrong will be printed to stderr.  So, they'll end up in your
terminal, but you can separate them from everything else with something like:
"runEventLoop data.txt mc.txt 2> errors.txt"
